ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Normalize All Parameters to LinkedInâ€™s Dataset Format**

For each ICP:

â€¢ **Industry** â†’ Use LinkedIn's exact industry names (e.g. "Consulting & Management Services", "Information Technology & Services")  
â€¢ **Company Size** â†’ Use LinkedIn's predefined ranges: 1â€“10, 11â€“50, 51â€“200, 201â€“500, 501â€“1000, 1001â€“5000, 5001â€“10,000, 10,001+  
â€¢ **Revenue** â†’ Map to LinkedIn's revenue bands (e.g. ">1M<5M USD", ">5M<10M USD", ">10M<50M USD")  
â€¢ **Location** â†’ Use LinkedIn location syntax: "City, Country" or "Region, Country"  
â€¢ **Funding Stage** â†’ Use values like: "Bootstrapped", "Pre-Seed", "Seed", "Series A", "Series B", "Series C", "Public", "Private Equity"  
â€¢ **Titles** â†’ Ensure all job titles use LinkedInâ€™s phrasing  
â€¢ **Keywords** â†’ Only include terms likely found in headline or summary fields on LinkedIn

ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Output a JSON Object per ICP Profile**

For each ICP profile, return:

```json
{
  "icpName": "<ICP Name>",
  "searchFilters": {
    "industry": "<LinkedIn industry>",
    "companySize": "<LinkedIn company size>",
    "revenue": "<LinkedIn revenue band>",
    "location": "<LinkedIn location>",
    "fundingStage": "<LinkedIn funding stage>",
    "titleKeywords": ["<job title 1>", "<job title 2>", "..."],
    "influencerTitles": ["<title 1>", "..."],
    "keywordsInProfile": ["<pain point 1>", "..."],
    "growthSignals": ["<signal 1>", "..."]
  },
  "searchQuery": "<Final LinkedIn Boolean search query>"
}
```

---

ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Build the Boolean Search Query Using LinkedIn Syntax**

Format the `searchQuery` string with the following structure:

```
(title:"..." OR title:"...") 
AND industry:"..." 
AND companySize:... 
AND revenue:... 
AND location:"..." 
AND fundingStage:"..." 
AND ((headline:"..." OR summary:"...") OR ...) 
AND ((headline:"..." OR summary:"...") OR ...)
```

Notes:

â€¢ Use `AND` between filters.  
â€¢ Use `OR` between titles and keywords.  
â€¢ Search in `headline` or `summary` for both pain points and growth signals.  
â€¢ Return **only** a JSON array of objects for each ICP. **No additional text.**

ðŸ“¦ **Input ICP Report**:  
```json
{icp_data}
```

Return a JSON array of generated search queries per ICP profile.
